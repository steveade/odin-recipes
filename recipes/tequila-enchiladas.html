    <li>3 cups tequila</li>
    <li>3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed and diced</li>
    <li>3 cups uncooked rice</li>
    <li>2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers, divided</li>
    <li>4 (7.75 ounce) cans spicy enchilada sauce</li>
    <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans mild enchilada sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) bag shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
    <li>12 (12 inch) flour tortillas, or more as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine beef roast, tequila, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in a slow
      cooker. Cover and cook on Low until tender, 12 to 18 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shred beef using 2 forks; let it cool, about 30 minutes. Transfer
      shredded beef to a plate using a slotted spoon, reserving cooking liquid
      in the slow cooker.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour reserved cooking liquid into a large pot; stir in rice. Bring to a
      boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender
      and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      Mix black beans, refried beans, and 1 can green chile peppers together
      in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix spicy enchilada sauce, mild enchilada sauce, and tomato paste
      together in a bowl until smooth. Spread a thin layer of sauce in the
      bottom of a deep baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spoon 1/4 cup bean mixture, 1/4 cup rice, 1/2 cup shredded beef, 1
      tablespoon sauce, and 2 tablespoons Mexican cheese blend over 1
      tortilla. Roll up tortilla and place seam side-down in the baking dish.
      Repeat with remaining ingredients until baking pan is full.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover tortillas with a thick layer of sauce and remaining cheese. Spread
      remaining 1 can green chile peppers over cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubby and golden brown, 45
      minutes to 1 hour.
    </li>
  </ol>
