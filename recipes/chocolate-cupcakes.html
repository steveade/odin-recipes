    <img src="../images/chocolate-cupcakes.jpeg" alt="image of two chocolate cupcakes" width="500" height="500">
    <p>Chocolate cupcakes are the ultimate party food. These are super moist and bursting with rich, chocolaty flavor â€”
        and they're so easy to make.</p>
    <p>Frost these delicious chocolate cupcakes with buttercream or cream cheese frosting, or try royal icing or even
        whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 &frac13; cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>&frac34; cups of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoons of baking soda</li>
        <li>&frac18; teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>&frac34; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil liners.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
            well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with milk; beat
            well. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes.
            Remove from the oven and let cool before serving or frosting.</li>
